Flower Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow! This project showcases a robust system that accurately categorizes flower images into five distinct classes: Daisy, Dandelion, Roses, Sunflowers, and Tulips.



üåø Project Stages:



1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Acquisition:

The project commenced by acquiring the flower images data, which was in the tgz format. Following the data download, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the images, gaining a deep understanding of their characteristics and visual attributes.



2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Creation:

Subsequently, I created a meticulously organized dataset comprising separate sets for training, validation, and testing. The powerful TensorFlow library facilitated this process through its efficient image_dataset_from_directory function. To optimize the performance of the datasets, I leveraged TensorFlow's features such as td.data.AUTOTUNE, cache(), and prefetch().



3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development and Maintenance:

The project then progressed through three crucial stages of model development and maintenance, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.



  - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Standard Model Development:

   In this phase, I constructed a deep learning model as a baseline for evaluation.



  - 2Ô∏è‚É£ Overfitting Mitigation:

   To address the challenge of overfitting and further enhance the model's classification accuracy, I implemented advanced techniques. These included regularization, dropout, and early stopping mechanisms. By incorporating these techniques, the model achieved better generalization and minimized the risk of overfitting.



  - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Expansion:

   In order to enrich the training data, I expanded the dataset by scraping an additional 5,000 diverse flower images from the internet, obtaining approximately 1,000 images for each flower class. These augmented images were then combined with the original dataset, enhancing the model's training process.(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uht92rhzqDVxpD44fwkC4AjuRC2tO0nj/view?usp=sharing)
