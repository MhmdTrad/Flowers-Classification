<h3>Project Goal: Flower Image Classification Using TensorFlow</h3>

In this project, the objective is to develop a flower image classification system using the TensorFlow deep learning framework. The aim is to accurately categorize flower images into five distinct classes:

- Daisy
- Dandelion
- Roses
- Sunflowers
- Tulips

<h2>To achieve this goal, the project will be executed in three stages:</h2>

1. Standard Model Development: A standard deep learning model will be constructed using TensorFlow. This initial model will serve as a baseline for comparison and performance evaluation.

2. Overfitting Mitigation: Various techniques will be employed to address the issue of overfitting, a common challenge in deep learning. These techniques may include regularization, dropout, or early stopping. By implementing these strategies, an improved model will be developed to enhance the classification accuracy.

3. Data Expansion: To further enhance the model's performance, a larger dataset will be created by scraping flower images from the internet. Approximately 5,000 images will be collected, with approximately 1,000 images per flower class. This expanded dataset will be used for training the final model, enabling it to learn from a more diverse set of examples and potentially improve its classification accuracy.

By following this approach, the project aims to develop a robust flower image classification system that can accurately categorize flower images into their respective classes.
